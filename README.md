**Introduction**

HarvestWise is an innovative app designed to help farmers make informed decisions by providing real-time insights into climate and soil conditions. It simplifies complex data from various sources, enabling farmers to better manage their crops and mitigate risks from adverse weather. With predictive models that anticipate climate threats, the app supports farmers in optimizing crop yields and reducing losses, promoting sustainable farming practices through advanced, data-driven tools.

**Background**

2023 was considered one of the driest years in history, 67 out of 72 municipalities in Sonora suffer from drought and water scarcity due to the low levels of rainfall.

Sonora faces significant agricultural challenges due to climate change, especially with is highly variable water resources. Extremely high temperatures and irregular precipitation have affected crop yields. Climate models predict further reductions in water availability, directly impacting the productivity of crops. These challenges have broader economic implications, as agriculture is a vital industry in Sonora. Over the years, climate has contributed to important financial losses in Mexico's agricultural sector. 

HarvesWise can play a crucial role in supporting farmers in Sonora, and hopefully the world, by providing them with critical data on climate and other conditions. By offering insights into weather patterns and potential crop risks, the app can help mitigate the negative effects of climate variability and promote sustainable agricultural practices.

**Theoretical Framework**

**Droughts:**

Mexico is cataloged as highly vulnerable to droughts since around 52% of its territory has a semi-arid or arid climate. Droughts are defined as the decrease or absence of rainfall compared to the annual rate. Droughts are a normal event and they occur in all climate zones. In Mexico, for example, droughts occur every 20 years. However, they aggravate due to poor resource management and climate change. 

All droughts originate due to the lack of rainfall, nevertheless, there are 3 types of droughts:

Meteorological: Absence of precipitation during a determined time lapse.

Agricultural: It happens after a meteorological drought because, after this, the soil does not have adequate moisture for cultivation.

Hydrological: Occurs when, due to the lack of rainfall, the level of water bodies progressively decreases, to the extent of even completely depleting.

The losses caused by droughts in the last years have been billionaire. This has caused the price of the Mexican basic shopping basket to rise by 80% in the last 5 years. Besides, hundreds of thousands of farmers have had to migrate, from rural communities to cities or even abroad, due to the lack of income caused by droughts; at the same time, this causes high levels of unemployment.

Droughts not only cause havoc in the agricultural sector, but also in the livestock sector, and many others.



**Floods:**

A flood occurs when water surpasses the absorption capacity of the soil and other natural and artificial draining systems.
They get classified according to their water volume, precipitation rate, and rainfall duration:

Slight Flooding: Intense rainfall that creates poodles that drain in less than 24 hours. Only sensitive crops are affected.

Moderate Flooding: Rainfall that causes stagnant water for 2-3 days. It affects sensitive crops, such as corn and beans, due to the loss of oxygen in the roots.

Severe Flooding: Prolonged rains that keep water stagnant for more than 4-5 days. Most crops are severely damaged or lost, except for rice.

Soil Saturation: Even if there is no visible water on the surface, the soil could be saturated, affecting plant growth. This “invisible” flooding can be just as damaging as a surface flood.

River Flood: Occurs when rivers or streams overflow due to intense rainfall, thaws, or dam break.

How do floods affect plants and crops?

Plants suffocate due to the lack of oxygen in the soil, therefore, roots cannot breathe. Floods also cause the loss of nutrients, making plants grow poorly. Another consequence may be the loss of soil due to erosion. There are crops, such as corn, beans, and tomatoes, that are very sensitive to the lack of oxygen on the floor, making them the most affected crops during floodings. 

An important aspect to consider is that floods affect crops differently depending on their growth stage. This means that the smaller the crops, the more they get affected.












**Soil Humidity:**

Soil humidity is the most difficult environment characteristic to manipulate since this condition is given by different internal factors such as air temperature, plant transpiration, and soil evapotranspiration. However, it is a very important aspect to consider when growing crops.

Reasons why agricultural activities are affected:

**Climate Change:**

Extreme events such as droughts, intense rainfall, or frosts can damage crops.
 
Temperatures outside normal affect growth and production.
Soil Degradation:

Erosion and loss of the fertile layer.

Lack of nutrients due to the excessive use of soil without crop rotation.

Soil compaction that hinders root growth.

**Pests and Diseases:**

Insect pests that destroy crops.

Diseases caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that affect plants.

**Lack of Water:**

Droughts that limit irrigation.

Water pollution, which affects irrigation quality.

Unsustainable Agricultural Practices:

Monocultures that impoverish the soil and increase the risk of pests.
 
Excessive use of chemicals that damage the soil and water.
 
**Biodiversity Loss:**

Decrease in pollinators (such as bees).
 
Disappearance of native species that contribute to the agricultural system.
 
**Natural Disasters:**

Floods, earthquakes, or landslides that destroy crops.

**Socioeconomic Problems:**

Lack of access to technology or resources limits the ability to adapt.

Armed conflict interrupts production and destroys agricultural fields. 

**Preventive Measures Against Common Agricultural Disasters**

**In Response to Heavy Rainfall:**

Proper Drainage Systems: Implementing adequate drainage systems is essential to prevent flooding, which can severely damage crops. Techniques such as building trenches or channels to divert excess water help mitigate the risk.

Soil Covering: Using methods like mulch or cover crops can reduce soil erosion and enhance water infiltration. This helps protect the soil during heavy rain.
Weather Monitoring: Leveraging weather forecast applications allows farmers to anticipate rainfall and plan agricultural activities accordingly, avoiding planting or harvesting during heavy rain periods.

**During Droughts:**

Efficient Irrigation: Employing drip irrigation or sensor-controlled automated systems can optimize water use, minimizing waste by watering only when the soil requires it. These technologies are critical in conserving water during dry spells.

Drought-Resistant Crops: Selecting crop varieties that are more drought-tolerant or that require less water can reduce vulnerability to prolonged dry periods.
Water Storage: Constructing reservoirs or cisterns to collect and store rainwater ensures that farmers have access to water during drought conditions.

**Against Water Contamination:**

Water Filtration and Treatment: Installing filtration systems to remove contaminants before irrigation is vital, particularly in areas near industrial zones or where chemical products are used.

Responsible Fertilizer and Pesticide Use: Minimizing chemical use and opting for organic alternatives can prevent water pollution. Applying these products only when necessary further reduces environmental risks.

Water Quality Monitoring: Regular testing and the use of sensors can help detect potential water contamination, enabling preventive measures to protect crops and the environment.

Preventing Damage from Extreme Weather Events:

Crop Diversification: By cultivating a variety of crops, farmers can reduce the risk of losing an entire harvest to extreme weather conditions.
Agricultural Insurance: Securing crop insurance that covers losses from extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, or floods can provide financial protection.

Crop Rotation: This method improves soil health and helps prevent erosion and nutrient loss, particularly after periods of intense rain or drought.

**Long-Term Planning:**

Predictive Models: Utilizing platforms, that offer seasonal and long-term climate forecasts, helps farmers plan their planting and harvesting seasons more effectively.

Monitoring Technologies: Mobile applications can be employed to monitor crop health and soil moisture levels, enabling real-time data-driven adjustments to farming practices.

**Climate change affects the countryside, how to confront it?**

Climate change is the modification of the climate concerning the climatic history on a global or regional scale, which results in the alteration of the patterns of meteorological events such as cold fronts, hurricanes, frosts, extreme rains, and also: drought or excess of humidity, average winter temperature, etc.

These changes affect crop yields; they generate loss of livestock, and destruction of crops; These extreme variations in temperatures cause, in transmission areas, pests and diseases to spread rapidly with devastating consequences in the agricultural sector.

**Making of the app:**

First we defined how our main screen should look like on a whiteboard as well as define all the other information that could prove useful to us such as possible databases we could use or what the challenge was asking us to do. 

After defining the design and functionality of our application, our programming team began development using Flutter. We chose Flutter because it compiles directly into native code and is widely regarded as one of the most user-friendly frameworks within the mobile app development community. Once the main screen was designed, we proceeded to implement key functionalities, such as the plant care guide and the location picker. The location picker allows users to select a dynamic location in case they wish to access data from a different area or if they lack a stable internet connection. In such cases, they can download historical data for the selected latitude. Please note that our application will store data from up to two days prior.

![image10](./images/image10.png)



**Other Screens:**

After completing the functionality of the main screen, we moved on to populate the additional screens in the app and set up navigation for specific button interactions. This process followed the same approach as before: first, we planned the design of each interface, and then we defined the corresponding functionality. Once the functionalities were outlined, our team collaborated to connect the APIs assigned to each screen.

Unfortunately, despite our efforts, we were unable to implement real-time data using the APIs for the prototype at this stage. As a result, we decided to limit the scope to the city of Obregón in Sonora, Mexico, and focused on obtaining information regarding water levels, plant types, solar radiation, and temperature. We used this data to generate graphs illustrating the expected output once the prototype is fully operational. These graphs were displayed on the screens related to water, ground conditions, and solar radiation, each accompanied by a brief description explaining the data and its impact on plant life.

For the plant widget, we implemented functionality that suggests which crops farmers should plant based on the data collected by the APIs. Additionally, we included a button that displays a list of crops, allowing users to add a photo and data about the suitability of the selected crop according to current environmental conditions. However, this functionality currently uses placeholder names for the plants, as we do not have access to real-time data at the time of writing this prototype.

**Future Integration:**

As the project progresses, we plan to integrate the real-time data by establishing connections between our APIs and external databases that track environmental metrics such as water levels, soil conditions, and weather patterns. Our team will work on refining the APIs to ensure seamless communication between the app and these data sources. Additionally, we will implement cloud-based storage solutions to manage and synchronize user data, allowing the app to deliver accurate and up-to-date information tailored to each location. This will enable full functionality for the plant widget and ensure that farmers receive real-time insights to optimize their crop selection and care.

Finally we managed to integrate everything and run it with android studio to be able to display HarvestWise.



We also created a design prototype, including logo, color palette and overall branding. With the help of Figma Studio and Canva, we were able to design the future interface of HarvestWise.
